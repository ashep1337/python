# python

This is my projects from Udemy's 100 days of code course

Week one has very basic examples of learning if/then, for and while loops, as well as basic syntax.

Week two has more beginner examples but starts to get more complex with functions and building up how to reason projects out with available logic.

Week three gets more advanced with learning about OOP. Started working with classes, objects attributes, and methods. Also learning about importing modules and have started doing projects from start to finish with no provided templates.
